Feature: Verify volunteer information
As a coordinator
So that I can keep track of who signs up for what event and what position
I want to store volunteer information for an event

Scenario: verify volunteer information
  Given volunteer information was entered correctly
  Then I go to the confirm page/spreadsheet
  Then I review volunteer information
  And I confirm volunteer information
  Then I should see volunteers assigned to a position at an event
