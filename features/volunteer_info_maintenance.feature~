Feature: Maintain volunteer information
  As an operations director
  So that I can maintain/protect submitted information from the volunteer
  I want to access volunteer information  # changed this to be specifically a task, not a goal

  # should we have a separate privacy feature, which specifies scenarios where malicious users
  # attempt to access data

Scenario: maintain information
  When I go to the Confirm Page 
  Then I should see "Tupac Shakur, tupacshakur@gmail.com, Holiday Party, Helper"
